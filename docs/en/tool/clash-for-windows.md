The old archive is not an official, maintained, or integrity-verifiable distribution source, so this page no longer links it. Install a maintained replacement above. The remaining steps and screenshots exist only for subscription migration and settings identification on an old device. Do not download similarly named `.7z`, `.exe`, or `.dmg` files from search results.

## Add Clash Configuration Subscription

### **Add Subscription:**

In the **Jego - Control Panel**, click on **Subscription Nodes** in the left navigation bar, find the **Clash/Mihomo Series** subscription address and click **Copy**.

<img src="/images/image_spaces_2FtaiByLw8cj0IZKJTlaiM_2Fuploads_2F0ItaMGtYXVi98CkgiosU_2Fimage_1.png" alt="Proxies page">

The main function of the Proxies page is to **switch proxy modes** and **switch nodes**

#### Switch Proxy Mode {#switch-proxy-mode}

Clash has three working modes:

* Global: All requests are sent directly to the **proxy server**
* Rule: All requests are **routed according to configuration file rules**
* Direct: All requests are **sent directly to the destination**

When switching different modes, the corresponding node list will change accordingly

#### Switch Nodes {#switch-nodes}

::: tip Latency Test
Latency test (network icon) can test the latency of all nodes. You can modify the test URL in Settings→Latency Test URL

Nodes are separated by policy groups and can be tested for latency by group, making it easy to select nodes with lower latency.

## Common Issues {#qa}

### **Precautions for First Running Clash**

1. Do not turn off the system firewall or exit security software globally. If launch is blocked, verify the Clash executable's source and integrity, then create only the minimum app-specific exception and remove it when no longer needed.
2. Must extract before running, cannot run directly in the compressed package.
3. After running, the Clash icon "cat" will be displayed in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen.
   * If you can't see the Clash icon, it may be hidden. Click to show hidden icons.
   * Double-click the taskbar Clash icon to display the software main interface.

### Get Subscription Address

1. Be sure to 🚫 **disable web translation function**, otherwise the obtained subscription address may be incorrect.
2. In the **Jego - Control Panel**, select **Mobile Proxy** in the left navigation, find the **Clash for Windows** subscription address, and click **Copy**.

### **Subscription download or update fails**

The following 3 reasons are most common, check in the following order:

1. **🐷 Wrong subscription address**
   * Make sure the subscription address is copied from the **Jego - Control Panel**.
2. **📶 Network reasons**
   * Try changing networks, such as: your own or friend's mobile hotspot, home, company, neighbor's WIFI, etc.
   * Try turning off Clash > General > System Proxy.
   * Try exiting other VPN or proxy software.
   * Try restarting computer, modem, router.
   * Keep the system firewall on. If logs identify a blocked browser or client, add only a narrowly scoped app exception permitted by the operating system or administrator, then remove temporary rules after testing.

## Set Proxy Mode

Go to the "Proxies" interface and select the proxy mode according to your needs:

### **Global Connection | Global: Proxy all traffic**

* Suitable for users who do not rely on domestic services.
* Very effective for foreign traffic, domestic traffic will be slowed down.
* In this mode 🈲 **cannot select DIRECT and REJECT nodes**, they will cause inability to access the internet.

### **Rule Judgment | Rules: Only proxy foreign traffic**

Suitable for users who use both domestic and foreign services.

* Whether traffic is direct or proxied depends on the active configuration; account UI determines how it counts toward the plan.
* When querying IP on domestic websites, you get the local IP address.
* When querying IP on foreign websites, you get the proxy IP address.

Traffic routing rules cannot be comprehensive and have timeliness. If you encounter the following situations, try global proxy.

* Unable to open international websites;
* Slow loading of international websites;
* Unable to unlock Netflix / Spotify and other region-restricted content.

### **Direct Connection | Direct: Do not proxy any traffic**

Choosing this mode will result in inability to bypass restrictions, with the same effect as turning off VPN.

### **Script Mode | Script: Flexibly customize rules**

Official manual: [https://lancellc.gitbook.io/clash/clash-config-file/script](https://lancellc.gitbook.io/clash/clash-config-file/script)

## Troubleshooting

### **Chrome does not connect after selecting an available node**

There are 2 reasons:

* **1️⃣ Conflict with Jego extension**.

  1. Go to Chrome > Jego
  2. Switch Jego's mode to direct mode in the extension popup.

* **2️⃣ Insufficient permissions to follow system proxy.**
  1. Right-click on Chrome shortcut, select Properties.
  2. Add **one space** and **startup parameter** after the target: --proxy-server="http://127.0.0.1:7890"

### **360 / QQ / Sogou or another browser cannot access foreign websites**

Do not use domestic browsers to access foreign websites to prevent leaking browser history.

For domestic browsers that cannot be used, we do not provide technical support.

### **LINE cannot connect to the server**

LINE does not follow system proxy settings and needs to manually configure proxy in LINE's advanced settings:

1. Ensure the browser can normally access foreign websites.
2. ✅ Enable proxy server
3. Proxy server: **HTTP** or **SOCKS5**
4. Server: **127.0.0.1**:**7890**
